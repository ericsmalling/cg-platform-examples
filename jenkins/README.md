# Chainguard Jenkins Demo

A self-contained Jenkins server running on Chainguard images, with seven pipeline jobs that build and test sample applications across Java, Python, and Node — using Chainguard `*-dev` build images and Chainguard runtime images throughout.

All Jenkins infrastructure and all build/test/runtime images come from `cgr.dev/<your-chainguard-org>`. Pick your org once via [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) (it prompts and persists to `.env`) — see [Configuration](#configuration).

## Sample applications

| Job name | Stack | Build image | Runtime image | Artifact |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------------|----------|
| [`corretto-java17-maven`](apps/corretto-java17-maven/)   | Spring Boot console app, Maven  | `maven:3-jdk17-dev`     | `amazon-corretto-jre:17`    | runnable JAR (Jenkins archive) |
| [`adoptium-java8-jetty`](apps/adoptium-java8-jetty/)     | JSP web app, Maven, Jetty 9.4   | `maven:3-jdk8-dev`      | `adoptium-jre:adoptium-openjdk-8` | runnable WAR (Jenkins archive) |
| [`openjdk21-gradle`](apps/openjdk21-gradle/)             | CLI app, Gradle 8.14            | `jdk:openjdk-21-dev`    | `jre:openjdk-21`            | runnable JAR (Jenkins archive) |
| [`python314-uv-flask`](apps/python314-uv-flask/)         | Flask web app, `uv`             | `python:3.14-dev`       | `python:3.14`               | OCI image → `$PUSH_REGISTRY/pytest:3-14` |
| [`python312-pip-django`](apps/python312-pip-django/)     | Django site, `pip`              | `python:3.12-dev`       | `python:3.12`               | OCI image → `$PUSH_REGISTRY/pytest:3-12` |
| [`node22-npm-express`](apps/node22-npm-express/)         | Express web app, `npm`          | `node:22-dev`           | `node:22`                   | OCI image → `$PUSH_REGISTRY/nodetest:22` |
| [`node25-pnpm-express`](apps/node25-pnpm-express/)       | Express web app, `pnpm`         | `node:25-dev`           | `node:25-slim`              | OCI image → `$PUSH_REGISTRY/nodetest:25` |

> `$PUSH_REGISTRY` is set by `setup.sh` (and persisted in `.env`) — typically a `ttl.sh/<your-prefix>` for the public ttl.sh mode, or `localhost/library` when pushing to the optional Harbor mirror in Mode C.

(Java pipelines archive their build artifact directly into Jenkins. Python/Node pipelines build an OCI image and push it to [ttl.sh](https://ttl.sh/) — an anonymous-push registry where tags expire after 24h. Re-run a pipeline to refresh.)

```

Jenkins is built from [Dockerfile.jenkins](Dockerfile.jenkins), which layers a fixed plugin set and the Chainguard `docker-cli` binary onto `cgr.dev/$CHAINGUARD_ORG/jenkins:2-lts-jdk21-dev` (the controller runs on JDK 21; sample apps targeting older JDKs build inside their own per-stage Chainguard images). On startup, [Jenkins Configuration as Code (JCasC)](jenkins/casc/jenkins.yaml) creates the admin user and seeds pipeline jobs from [jobs.groovy](jenkins/casc/jobs.groovy) by reading each app's `Jenkinsfile` from disk.

The controller talks to the **host's Docker daemon** via the mounted `/var/run/docker.sock` (DooD pattern). When a pipeline stage uses `agent { docker { image '...' } }`, Jenkins asks the host to spawn the build container. To make this work cleanly, `JENKINS_HOME` is bind-mounted from `/tmp/cgjenkins-home` at the **same absolute path on host and container** — so when the controller hands the host a `-v <workspace>:<workspace>` flag, the workspace path actually exists on the host.

Each sample application lives under [apps/](apps/) as if it were a separate repository. The controller's first pipeline stage (`Checkout`) copies the app sources from the bind-mounted `/sources/apps/<name>/` into the workspace. Subsequent stages stash/unstash to share artifacts.

Pipelines never hardcode image strings. Instead they call `cgImage('<token>')` from the [cgImages shared library](shared-libraries/cg-images/) — e.g. `cgImage('corretto-java17').build` resolves to the right `cgr.dev/<org>/maven:3-jdk17-dev@sha256:<digest>`. Catalog entries are pinned by digest for reproducibility. The library is auto-loaded by JCasC from a bind-mounted filesystem path, so adding/changing a token is a one-file edit and the next pipeline run picks it up automatically (no controller restart needed). See the library's [README](shared-libraries/cg-images/README.md#caveats) for caveats around editing it.

A scheduled Jenkins job, [refresh-cgimages-digests](ops/refresh-cgimages-digests/), re-resolves every catalog entry against the registry every 4 hours so digest pins keep up with upstream tag movements automatically.

## Prerequisites

- Docker (Docker Desktop, OrbStack, or Linux Docker engine)
- `chainctl` CLI, authenticated against an org with access to `cgr.dev/<your-org>/*`

Verify auth:
```sh
chainctl auth status
```

## Configuration

The demo pulls Chainguard images from whatever Chainguard org you configure. There is **no built-in default** — `setup.sh` prompts on first run and persists your answer in `.env` for re-runs:

```sh
./setup.sh
# ==> No Chainguard org configured.
#     Examples: 'chainguard' (public catalog) or 'your-org.example.com'.
#     Enter your Chainguard org: chainguard
```

`.env` is loaded automatically by `docker-compose`, propagated to the controller container as an env var, and consumed by Jenkinsfiles (via `env.CHAINGUARD_ORG`), the controller Dockerfile, and per-app Dockerfiles (via build ARG).

To switch orgs, edit `CHAINGUARD_ORG` in `.env` (or unset it to be re-prompted) and re-run `./setup.sh`. The Chainguard assumed identity is org-scoped, so it'll be torn down and recreated against the new org.

Before bringing the stack up, `setup.sh` runs a **preflight image-accessibility probe** against `cgr.dev/<your-org>/` for every image the demo will pull (controller, build/test/runtime, Harbor microservices in Modes B/C, plus cosign/crane/chainctl). If any image isn't accessible, setup aborts with the offending list and a hint about the likely cause (auth, missing access grant, wrong org). Bypass with `SKIP_PREFLIGHT=1 ./setup.sh` if you need to.

## Quick start

[setup.sh](setup.sh) is interactive and supports **three modes** for image flow. Pick one when prompted:

| | Pull source | Push target | Auth path |
|-|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Mode A** | `cgr.dev/<org>` directly | `ttl.sh/<prefix>` (default) | OIDC assumed identity (per-build, short-lived) |
| **Mode B** | `localhost/cgr-proxy/<org>` (Harbor proxy cache) | `ttl.sh/<prefix>` (default) | None — anonymous pulls + ttl.sh anonymous pushes |
| **Mode C** | `localhost/cgr-proxy/<org>` (Harbor proxy cache) | `localhost/library` (Harbor) | Anonymous pulls + Harbor admin creds for push |

Modes B and C stand up Harbor in a local `kind` cluster. They require `kind`, `kubectl`, `helm`, `terraform`, and `envsubst` on the host. The Harbor admin UI lives at <https://localhost/harbor> (self-signed cert — click through the browser warning once). The registry path stays on `http://localhost` so `docker push` works without daemon-trust gymnastics. See [harbor/README.md](harbor/README.md) for the architecture details and a note on why the UI must be HTTPS.

```sh
cd jenkins
./setup.sh
```

The script asks three questions, lays out the chosen mode in `.env`, builds & starts (or recreates) Jenkins, and either bootstraps the OIDC assumed identity (Mode A) or deploys Harbor (Modes B/C). Re-run any time to switch modes.

> **Mode A caveat:** the `oidc-provider` plugin regenerates its RSA signing key on JCasC re-apply, which invalidates the JWKS uploaded to Chainguard. **Re-run setup.sh after any restart of the Jenkins controller** (`docker compose restart`, `down`/`up`, or `--force-recreate`). Modes B/C aren't affected by this since they don't use OIDC.

Open <http://localhost:8080> (`admin` / `admin`; override the password via `JENKINS_ADMIN_PASSWORD` in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)). You should see all seven sample jobs plus the `refresh-cgimages-digests` ops job. Click any sample → **Build Now**. Each pipeline runs roughly the same shape:

1. **Auth** — `cgLogin()` (a shared-library var) handles auth for whichever mode is active: Mode A runs the OIDC chainctl exchange; Mode B is a no-op (anonymous pulls); Mode C writes Harbor admin creds for push.
2. **Checkout** — `cp -R /sources/apps/<name>/. .` from the bind-mounted source dir into the build workspace.
3. **Build (deps)** — install/compile in a Chainguard `*-dev` agent container.
4. **Test** — smoke-test in either the runtime image or its `-dev` variant (see [Common gotchas](#common-gotchas) below).
5. **Archive / Push** — Java pipelines archive their JAR/WAR to Jenkins. Python/Node pipelines build a runtime OCI image and push it to `$PUSH_REGISTRY` (ttl.sh in Modes A/B, the local Harbor `library` project in Mode C).
6. **Sign / Verify** *(OCI-image pipelines only)* — `cgSign()` signs the pushed image with cosign using a keypair generated once by `setup.sh` (cached on disk at `/tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets/`). At Jenkins boot, JCasC reads those files and registers them as three encrypted credentials in the Jenkins store: `cosign-private-key` (Secret file), `cosign-public-key` (Secret file), and `cosign-password` (Secret text). Pipelines pull them via `withCredentials()` — Jenkins materializes the key as a workspace temp file and masks the password in build logs. `cgVerify()` then re-pulls the signature and validates it against the public-key credential, failing the build if it doesn't match. The signature lives as a sibling OCI artifact at `<repo>:sha256-<digest>.sig` in whatever registry was the push target. Cosign runs as a one-shot container with `--network host` (so `localhost` resolves to the same ingress the docker daemon uses) and inherits the controller's `$DOCKER_CONFIG` so it pushes the signature with the same credentials as `docker push`.

A clean build takes 10s–40s once images are cached locally; the Gradle pipeline is slower on first run (~1m45s) because the Gradle wrapper has to download the Gradle distribution.

### Verifying a signed image after the build

The public key sits at `/tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets/cosign.pub`. To check a pushed image from outside Jenkins, run cosign in a host-network container so `localhost` resolves to your ingress:

```sh
# Pick the RepoDigest whose repo matches the image you just pulled. A
# single image can have multiple RepoDigests in the local cache (one per
# registry/org it has been pushed to), and `{{index .RepoDigests 0}}`
# returns whichever happens to be first — which may not match the repo
# you want to verify. Filter by the repo prefix to be safe. cgSign and
# cgVerify use the same pattern internally.
IMAGE=localhost/library/pytest:3-14
REPO="${IMAGE%:*}"
DIGEST=$(docker image inspect --format '{{range .RepoDigests}}{{println .}}{{end}}' "$IMAGE" | grep -F "${REPO}@" | head -1)
# cosign's reference parser rejects bare 'localhost' (it tries Docker Hub),
# so rewrite to 'localhost:80' before passing to cosign:
DIGEST="${DIGEST/#localhost\//localhost:80/}"
docker run --rm --network host \
  -v /tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets:/secrets:ro \
  --entrypoint=/usr/bin/cosign \
  cgr.dev/${CHAINGUARD_ORG}/cosign:latest-dev \
  verify --allow-http-registry --key /secrets/cosign.pub "$DIGEST"
```

Use the **digest** form, not a tag — cosign signatures are bound to image digests. The keypair persists at `/tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets/` until `./teardown.sh` wipes it, so signatures from prior builds stay verifiable across `setup.sh` re-runs as long as that directory is intact.

## Adding another sample app

1. Create a directory under [apps/](apps/), e.g. `apps/my-new-app/`.
2. Add the application source plus a `Jenkinsfile`. Use the same shape as the existing ones — first stage should be `Auth` (`steps { cgLogin() }`), then `Checkout` does `cp -R /sources/apps/<name>/. .` and stash, subsequent stages unstash and run. Reference Chainguard images via `cgImage('<token>')` (see [shared-libraries/cg-images](shared-libraries/cg-images/)); add a new token there if needed.
3. Append one block to the `apps` list in [jenkins/casc/jobs.groovy](jenkins/casc/jobs.groovy).
4. Restart and reload Jenkins so JCasC re-runs the seed and the new job is loaded:
   ```sh
   docker compose restart jenkins
   curl -fsS -u admin:admin -X POST http://localhost:8080/reload \
     -H "Jenkins-Crumb: $(curl -fsS -u admin:admin -c /tmp/jc -b /tmp/jc \
        http://localhost:8080/crumbIssuer/api/json | jq -r .crumb)"
   ```
   (The restart writes the new job's `config.xml` to disk via JCasC, but Jenkins also needs an explicit `/reload` to pick it up at runtime.)

## Common gotchas

These bit me while building out the seven samples — useful to know up front when adding more.

- **Chainguard images all have an ENTRYPOINT.** Jenkins' `docker { image '...' }` agent runs `cat` to keep the container alive and then `docker exec`s commands into it. Without `args '--entrypoint='` Jenkins' `cat` becomes an arg to the image's entrypoint and the container exits immediately. Always add `args '--entrypoint='` to `agent { docker { } }` blocks.
- **Test stages use `-dev` variants instead of the shell-less runtime images** for the same `agent { docker { } }` reason — Jenkins' `sh` steps require a shell. The shell-less runtime image is still the production deployment target; the `-dev` variant is purely a CI convenience.
  - For Python and Node OCI-image pipelines, the Test stage runs the runtime image directly via `docker run --entrypoint=python|node ...` with an inline test script — no shell needed and you genuinely test the production artifact. See [`python314-uv-flask/Jenkinsfile`](apps/python314-uv-flask/Jenkinsfile) for the pattern.
- **Build agents run as uid 1000 with no writable HOME.** Several tools that cache to `~/.something` need help:
  - **Gradle**: `environment { GRADLE_USER_HOME = "${WORKSPACE}/.gradle" }`
  - **npm / pnpm**: `environment { HOME = "${WORKSPACE}" }`
- **Chainguard's `python:3.x-dev` runs as uid 65532**, which can't write to the system site-packages. For pipelines that want to `pip install --system` or `uv pip install --system`, pass `args '--user 0 --entrypoint='` in the Jenkinsfile **and** add `USER 0` to the corresponding stage in the Dockerfile.
- **OCI-image pipelines push to whatever `$PUSH_REGISTRY` resolves to**: `ttl.sh/<prefix>` in Modes A/B (anonymous, 24h TTL) or `localhost/library` in Mode C (Harbor admin auth supplied by `cgLogin`, sourced from `$HARBOR_ADMIN_PASSWORD` — defaults to the chart's `Harbor12345`, overridable in `.env`). Per-app `IMAGE` envs use `${env.PUSH_REGISTRY}/<app-name>:<tag>` — works for both ttl.sh and Harbor without per-mode pipeline edits.
- **The Auth stage must precede any `agent { docker { image '...' } }` stage**, because the docker-workflow plugin pulls the agent's image using whatever creds are in `$DOCKER_CONFIG` *at the start of that stage*. The current pipeline shape (`Auth` → `Checkout` → docker-agent stages) gets the ordering right; preserve it when adding new pipelines.

## Teardown

[`teardown.sh`](teardown.sh) reverses everything `setup.sh` (and Harbor's `deploy.sh`) put in place — Harbor kind cluster, Chainguard assumed identity (`terraform destroy`), Jenkins controller container + image, the persisted `/tmp/cgjenkins-home`, and all generated state/secret files. It prompts before doing anything destructive.

```sh
./teardown.sh             # keeps .env so re-running setup.sh remembers CHAINGUARD_ORG
./teardown.sh --wipe-env  # full reset, including .env
```

If you'd rather do it by hand (or skip a step):

```sh
harbor/teardown.sh                                         # delete the Harbor kind cluster
( cd iac && terraform destroy -auto-approve ... )          # release the Chainguard identity
docker compose down --rmi local --remove-orphans           # stop Jenkins
sudo rm -rf /tmp/cgjenkins-home                            # persisted Jenkins home
rm -rf .secrets harbor/.pull-token shared-libraries/cg-images/IDENTITY
```

## Notes

- The DooD pattern means Jenkins effectively has root-equivalent access to the host machine via the Docker socket. This is acceptable for a local demo but not for production.
