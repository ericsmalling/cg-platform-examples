// vars/cgVerify.groovy
//
// Verifies an OCI image signature using the demo's public key. Pulls the
// public key from Jenkins's credentials store (registered by JCasC at boot
// from /tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets/cosign.pub), validates the registry
// signature against it, and fails the build if the signature is missing
// or invalid. Pair with cgSign() in the preceding stage to demonstrate
// the full sign-then-verify loop.
//
// Cosign runs in a one-shot container with --network host for the same
// reason cgSign does — see that file for the full rationale. The cosign
// helper image itself is pulled from $PULL_REGISTRY so it works whether
// the controller has cgr.dev creds (Mode A) or only the anonymous Harbor
// proxy (Modes B/C).
//
// Usage from a stage on `agent any`:
//
//   stage('Verify') {
//     agent any
//     steps { cgVerify(env.IMAGE) }
//   }
//
// Resolves the same image-by-digest as cgSign so verification targets
// the exact bytes that were signed (not whatever a mutable tag may now
// point at).
