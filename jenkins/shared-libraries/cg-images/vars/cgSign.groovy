// vars/cgSign.groovy
//
// Signs a freshly-pushed OCI image with cosign using the demo's static
// keypair. The private key + password live in Jenkins's encrypted
// credentials store (registered by JCasC at boot from
// /tmp/cgjenkins-home/.secrets/) and are pulled in by `withCredentials`,
// which writes the key to a temp file in the build workspace and exposes
// the password as a masked env var. The signature is uploaded to the same
// registry the image lives in, as a sibling OCI artifact at
// <repo>:sha256-<digest>.sig — no Sigstore Fulcio/Rekor calls.
//
// Cosign runs as a one-shot container with --network host so that the
// `localhost` references used in Mode C (Harbor) resolve to the host's
// ingress instead of the Jenkins controller container's own loopback. We
// cannot run cosign in-process on the controller for the same reason. For
// Modes A/B the registry is ttl.sh (public DNS), so --network host is a
// no-op there but still consistent.
//
// Auth to the destination registry: cosign reads $DOCKER_CONFIG just like
// docker push does. We mount the controller's DOCKER_CONFIG dir read-only
// into the cosign container so it inherits whatever credentials cgLogin()
// wrote earlier in the pipeline (Harbor admin creds in Mode C; nothing
// needed in A/B since signatures push anonymously to ttl.sh).
//
// Usage from a stage on `agent any`:
//
//   stage('Sign') {
//     agent any
//     steps { cgSign(env.IMAGE) }
//   }
//
// Cosign needs an immutable digest reference, not a mutable tag, so we
// resolve $IMAGE → $IMAGE@sha256:<digest> via `docker image inspect`
// first. (Pipelines push the tag-only ref; the digest is what cosign
// signs.) `--allow-http-registry` is set because Mode C's localhost
// registry is HTTP-only — see harbor/cg/helm/values.template for why.
